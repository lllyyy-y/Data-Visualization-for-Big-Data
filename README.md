## Divorce Prediction – Big Data Visualization Team Project

This repository contains the code and analysis created for our team project in the Big Data Visualization course.
The main focus of the project was visualizing relationship-related survey data and identifying key patterns that influence divorce prediction using machine-learning models.

## Project Overview

Performed extensive data visualization to uncover trends in communication, conflict, trust, and emotional indicators.

Built multiple machine-learning models to classify divorce likelihood.

Used various visualization techniques to interpret model behavior, including:

Correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots

Feature importance graphs

SHAP-based interpretability visualizations

Organized the full workflow in a Jupyter notebook.

## Visualization Highlights

Relationship factors visualized through pair plots, bar charts, boxplots, and correlation matrices.

Visual explanations of model results using feature importance plots and decision-level SHAP charts.

Visual comparison of predictions across different model configurations.
